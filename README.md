Additional Notes:
The project consists of three main files - 
index.html: Contains the HTML structure of the data grid.
style.css: Defines the styling and layout of the grid.
data_grid.js: Implements the JavaScript logic for data manipulation and interaction.

This README provides a high-level overview of the project. You can explore the code within the files for a deeper understanding of the implementation.
